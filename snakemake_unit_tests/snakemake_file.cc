/*
  The parser reimplmentation will be structured as follows:

  - consider every piece of content of the file as *either*:
  -- a snakemake rule
  -- a (possibly incomplete) python instruction, which can further be classified
  as:
  --- unrelated to file parse
  --- an include directive (eventually split into: on strings or on
  variables/expressions

  The complete parse operation is as follows:

  1) add the top-level snakefile as a pseudo-include directive to the
  snakemake_file 2) parse the file, non-recursively 3) while unresolved
  snakemake rule and include directives remain:
  -- emit a dummy workspace containing a simplified representation of the
  currently loaded data
  ---- include directives and snakemake rules are assigned unique identifiers
  ---- their locations in file are replaced with tracking statements
  ---- python code unrelated to snakemake or include directives is included
  as-is
  -- run the python code, capture the screen output
  -- inspect queue of unresolved rules and include directives
  ---- if the next entry is a rule, determine whether the rule was evaluated and
  resolve, pop, continue
  ---- if the next entry is an include directive, determine whether the
  directive was evaluated
  ------ if not, flag it as such, do not process, pop, continue
  ------ if so, set it to resolved, pop it, stop processing resolutions
  -- parse the next include directive, without recursing. flag new rules and
  includes as potentially problematic


  Assorted comments:
  - the above logic is incredibly conservative, and designed to handle some
  additional issues not enumerated above (include directives on variables).
  - the logic can be loosened for some types of includes that can be handled in
  one pass, avoiding additional iterations of python evaluation. most notably,
  include directives at the same depth with no intervening python code, and
  0-depth includes in the currently parsed file.
